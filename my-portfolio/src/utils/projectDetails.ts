        description: `Used by 130 community users, this Web App helped them reconnect with 
        fellow musicians after regular activities and communication was disrupted by the pandemic. 
        Our app provides them a space to connect and find opportunities to collaborate and perform together
        in open mics and concert events.

        My team of 2 conducted user research closely with the community
        and designed this social web app, ensuring that the app fits perfectly
        into the user needs. Based off the community's requirements, the app is designed with mobile users in mind, 
        with simple and intuitive UI with features like a community Facebook-like forum and google authentication.
