        description: `Used by 130 community users, this web app was made for local music community Indigo Scales to 
        help them create a space for local musicians to network and find opportunities to collaborate in bands and perform together
        in open mics and concert events. 
        <br /><br />
        My team of 2 conducted user research closely with the community
        and designed this social web app, ensuring that the app fits perfectly
        into the user needs. Based off the community's requirements, the app is designed with mobile users in mind, 
        with intuitive UI compacted with many features.
        <br /><br />
        This webapp allows users to interact in a Facebook-inspired forum, creating their own posts
        and interacting with others via likes and comments, as well as searching and filtering posts. Musicians can also organise
        and attend events within the community, fostering strong bonds and collaboration. They can view each other profiles to connect
        with others of similar musical taste and share music they made via soundcloud api.
