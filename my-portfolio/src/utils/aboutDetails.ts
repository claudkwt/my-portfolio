  description: `Welcome to my corner of the digital universe! 
    I'm Claudia, a Software Engineer and UI/UX designer hailing from Singapore.
    With a background in product design and a penchant for tinkering with Robotics, I
    stumbled upon the captivating realm of web development and never looked
    back. My passion lies in crafting software that not only enhances our
    daily experiences but also leaves a meaningful impact on the world around
    us.

    <br /><br />
    
    These days I am busy with my research in interaction between humans and
    machines, with Singapore University of Technology & Design. When I'm not
    busy squashing digital bugs or pushing pixels, you'll often find me
    concocting culinary creations in the kitchen or scaling heights at climbing gyms.

    Feel free to explore my work and find out more about me!`,
